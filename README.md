## Go down, you cannot jump, find the treasure!

Dive into the depths in search of the Great Ruby, a legendary treasure, the last vestige of an ancient forgotten civilization. Your heavy diving suit won't allow you to jump, but you have unlimited air supply!

Explore the underwater labyrinth and find your way to the deepest cave, avoiding nasty dangers and enemies through secret doors and rooms. Will you be able to find all the golden coins?
